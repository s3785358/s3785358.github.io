											<h3>What Did The Test Mean?</h3>
											From the series of test results completed and gathered, i've analysed that i am a outgoing extroverted person, with good social skills. Through the “learning style test”, i’ve gathered that i'm a visual learner which speaks very true, meaning i will focus more on visually learning my material for me to gain the best understanding in the future. Through “My Personality Test” i'm identified as an outgoing person with perceiving as one of my strongest, this allows me to identify things that's harder to identify for others, which allows for myself to be a more observant. And finally through the “Big Five Personality test” its highlighted that i again, surpass all the other “Factor Labels” with extroversion excelling to be the highest one. This highlights to me that i can socialise with others better, allowing for myself to share my thoughts to one another easier.

											<h3>Behavioural Influence In A Team</h3>
											How do you think these results may influence your behaviour in a team?
These test results will allow me to become more observant by allowing for my perceiving attribute to take action, note taking everyone's natural responses to situations to allow myself to identify who i can easily discuss with in the group. My strong extraverted attribute will allow the easy discussion of team members as i would put them in ease, allowing for the non judgemental processes of thought sharing, while simultaneously achieving efficiency but creating a good team ethic. Through my observation, i will identify the learning styles of members, which will allow for the encouragement of learning by simultaneously fulfilling all peoples learning styles such as visual and auditory.

										</p>
										<p>
											<h3>Formulating A Team</h3>
											When forming a team, i will first prioritate the people who will be able to discuss with team members and participation is strongly valued. This will allow for a good team ethic with a lot of discussion where good pool of ideas will be generated. Something else i would be looking towards when formulating a team is the learning style of each individual. By creating a team with similar learning styles, it will benefit everyone as its easier for everyone to understand and it will motivate each individual when they understand the concepts to participate more in the discussions..
