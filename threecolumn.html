										<p>
											<h3>Development of intrest</h3>
My interest in IT derived from a young age, watching my sister play a old video game on the computer, fascinated by the complexity of the machine and how it works. My interest is in the technological changes that IT will bring upon to the world, and how it will benefit our lives and how we will create change in society through the use of technology. One specific person that has create influence in the world of IT and in me is Elon Musk, obsessed over his revolutionary ideas and his already made inventions following the self driving cars and his innovationary company “SpaceX”.

											<h3>Chosen School</h3>
RMIT is a ideal school as it is in the centre of Melbourne, meaning advantageous for all travelling on public transport. RMIT is a school that has been suggested by many for excellence in the courses of IT and design. I have chosen RMIT for its community and its wide range of diversity among its campus accompanied by its well broken down courses and its friendly environment.

												<h3>Expectations</h3>
												During my studies, i’m hoping to learn all aspects of Information Technology as i wish to dive deep to the world of IT and expand further to what field im truly passionate of. However i have curiosity in the field of VR and AR as i believe it will be a very big industry and i would like to see how the field of Virtual reality unfolds as it holds great possibilities.
