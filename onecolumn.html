											<h2>My Project Idea</h2>
											<h3>Virtual Reality Social Platform</h3>
										</header>
										<p>
											What is VR? VR is virtual reality where anything and everything you’ve dreamt of can coexist inside this machinery. The project will be a social platform accessible from VR and or AR. This platform eradicated the ice breaker segment where everyone hides behind a disguise of their own unique character. This allows them to socialise with a new sense of confidence and allow for them to express their ideas with animosity. This allows for the assistance of people who fear judgement to allow for them to learn to freely express the opinions and ideas.
										</p>
										<p>
											<h3>Possibilities of VR</h3>
											Imagine you’re in a field of emptiness, whatever you imagine. Everything and anything and with a click of a button it appears whether you want to meet darth Vader or explore Mordor from lord of the rings. Click of a button and the whole world is yours. This is mere possibility of VR where simulations of bomb diffusion can take place to take place in real life situations. This project of a social platform will revert to the old school no smart phone era where everyone is forced to talk to each other face to face for socialisation while simultaneously hiding their identity.
										</p>
										<p>
											<h3>Product and Service</h3>
											This is a new innovative social platform where people can virtually interact with each other discussing anything and everything behind a anonymous character. This allows for people who find socialising difficult to find a paradise. Through the implementation of this project, this allows for meetings to take place in a virtual world, this could be helpful as not everyone have availabilities particularly in overseas country, through the implement of VR, this allows for Visual representations to be present through Virtual Reality. Controllers who acts as hands of the users allow for the interaction with the virtual world, this can have the possibilities of reverting the presentation panels and other necessary features to allow for the presentation to run smoothly. This allows for virtual visual learning to occur, fulfilling its main purpose. Users have the ability to talk to each other through the devices of microphones, this will allow them to socialise and in the case of the presentation, fulfilling auditory learning styles and communicating all purposes easily. This social space can also act as a chill space, for leisure, the capability to explore the Marvel universe or the DC. Through this Virtual environment, users have the capability to host events which other users can attend to, this can be Yoga, presentation talks such as TED talks.
										</p>
										<p>
											<h3>Tools and Technology Required</h3>
											For the Virtual Experience occur, users require a high end computer with a high Graphics processing unit, this is due to the manipulation through the digital screen to create a 3D world. An VR device is required following controllers which allows for the interaction to the 3D world. Headphones and a microphone is suggested, this allows for the user to differentiate between the sounds from in front and behind.

										</p>
										<p>
											<h3>Skills required</h3>
											Programing skills are definitely required for the creation of the interactive world following by a Digital Designer for the creation of the layout of the environment. This requires high end computers as well as VR machines for test runs. This is a very hard goal however still feasible upon hard work. Through the directing of the program, teamwork is definitely required to be able to negotiate and discuss ideas, and organisation is strongly required, to be able to stay on track.
										</p>
										<p>
											<h3>Outcome</h3>
											If the project is to come live, Virtual space will be revolutionized for the better and socialising through virtual machines will become easier for everyone. Presentations and or ted Talks can be presented on the virtual platform allowing accessibility of everyone across the world, creating harmony in all.
